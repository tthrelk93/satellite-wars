Core Gameplay and random notes
1. Turn Phases:
Players alternate turns, with each turn consisting of several phases:
Deployment Phase: Launch new satellites or build ground stations.
Movement Phase: Move satellites in their orbits.
Action Phase: Perform actions such as scanning, attacking, or upgrading satellites.
2. Action Points:
Each turn, players are allocated a certain number of action points.
Actions: Deploying satellites, moving satellites, upgrading satellites, attacking enemy satellites, scanning sectors.
3. Fog of War:
Satellites have limited visibility based on their type (e.g., camera, radar).
Players must scout and reveal enemy positions, adding a layer of strategy.
Grid-Based Space with Orbital Mechanics
1. Orbital Mechanics:
Divide the game board into a grid that represents different orbital paths around Earth.
Satellites move along these orbital paths, and their positions change each turn.
Different orbits (e.g., geostationary, polar) offer different strategic advantages and challenges.
2. Field of View:
Each satellite has a field of view (FoV) based on its type and orbit.
The FoV determines which sectors of Earth are visible at any given time.
Players can place satellites in orbits that maximize their surveillance coverage or strategic advantage.
3. Grid Representation:
A 3D grid that can be simplified to 2D for easier gameplay representation.
Orbits are represented as tracks or paths on the grid, and each grid cell represents a specific segment of space.
Victory Conditions
1. Single Victory Condition to Start:
Control Key Sectors: Players aim to control critical sectors of space or specific strategic points on Earth.
Control is achieved by having the most advanced or numerous satellites in the sector.
Points are awarded for holding key sectors over time.
2. Strategic Launch Facilities:
At the game's start, each team selects a strategic launch facility on Earth.
Launch Facility Placement:
Near the equator: Benefits include more efficient launches, but it's easier to locate.
Remote locations: Harder to find but come with higher resource costs for launches.
Facility Defense: Players can build ground defenses or use satellites to protect their launch facilities.
3. Additional Victory Conditions (Future Expansion):
Surveillance Score: Gain points based on the amount and quality of surveillance data collected.
Resource Domination: Control resource-rich sectors of space or mine asteroids for resources.
Defeat Enemy HQ: Locate and destroy the enemy's launch facility or headquarters.
Additional Features and Mechanics
1. Satellite Types:
Communication Satellites: Provide network coverage, essential for coordination.
Surveillance Satellites: Equipped with cameras or radar for scanning Earth.
Defense Satellites: Capable of attacking or defending against enemy satellites.
Resource Satellites: Mine resources from asteroids or other space objects.
2. Satellite Upgrades:
Players can invest action points and resources to upgrade their satellites.
Upgrades include improved sensors, better propulsion, enhanced defense systems, etc.
3. Resource Management:
Players gather and manage resources such as fuel, technology components, and rare materials.
Resources are used for launching satellites, performing upgrades, and maintaining the network.
4. Random Events:
Introduce random space events like solar storms, meteor showers, or satellite malfunctions to add unpredictability.
Example Turn Structure
1. Deployment Phase:
Choose to launch new satellites or build ground stations.
Allocate resources and action points for deployment.
2. Movement Phase:
Move satellites along their orbital paths.
Consider optimal positions for surveillance or strategic advantage.
3. Action Phase:
Perform actions with satellites, such as scanning sectors, attacking enemy satellites, or upgrading capabilities.
Resolve any conflicts or attacks.
4. End of Turn:
Evaluate control of key sectors.
Update scores and resources based on current game state.



The cost of launching a satellite depends on several factors, including the location of the launch site, the type of satellite, and the orbit type. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why launch costs vary and how you can structure the funding system in your game:
Factors Influencing Launch Costs
Launch Site Location:
Proximity to the Equator:
Launching from sites near the equator is more efficient because the Earth's rotational velocity is highest at the equator (about 1670 km/h). This provides an additional boost to the launch vehicle, reducing the amount of fuel needed.
Altitude and Terrain:
Launch sites at higher altitudes can be more efficient because the rocket starts higher up, reducing atmospheric drag and the distance to space. However, rough or mountainous terrain can increase costs due to the difficulty of transporting and setting up equipment.
Type of Satellite:
Imaging Satellites (Polar Orbits):
Typically placed in sun-synchronous polar orbits to ensure consistent lighting for imaging. These orbits require launches to be timed precisely, often making them more expensive.
Communication Satellites (Geostationary Orbits):
Require launches to higher altitudes and specific equatorial orbits, which can be costlier due to the need for more powerful rockets and precise insertion into orbit.
Type of Orbit:
Low Earth Orbit (LEO):
Cheaper to reach due to the lower altitude (200-2000 km). Suitable for imaging satellites.
Geostationary Orbit (GEO):
Much higher altitude (about 35,786 km), requiring significantly more energy and hence more cost. Suitable for communication satellites.
