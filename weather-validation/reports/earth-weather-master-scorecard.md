- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-a2-partition-port.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-a2-partition-port.md)
- Best quick candidate: `ported-floor-soft-containment`
- Quick result:
  - improved metrics: `2 / 6`
  - severe regressions: none
  - preserved only partial current-branch partition gains:
    - `itczWidthDeg: 25.91 -> 25.826`
    - `subtropicalDryNorthRatio: 1.534 -> 1.507`
  - failed the circulation-recovery half of the contract:

- Summary:
  - Architecture A could preserve some partition gains
  - Architecture A could not recover SH dry-belt ratio, NH westerlies, or cross-equatorial vapor flux
  - the next family must rebuild circulation first, then re-port partition behavior
- Next active phase: `Architecture B1: circulation scaffold rebuild`

## Architecture B1 decision

- Verdict: `quick_reject`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-b1-circulation-scaffold.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-b1-circulation-scaffold.md)

- Best quick candidate: `soft-containment-omega-port`
- Quick result:
  - improved metrics: `1 / 6`
  - severe regressions: `itczWidthDeg`
  - partial movement:
    - `subtropicalDryNorthRatio: 1.534 -> 1.504`
  - but explicit circulation-state ports on the weakened B1 scaffold still failed:
    - `itczWidthDeg: 25.91 -> 26.219`

- Best quick candidate: `ported-floor-soft-containment-omega`
- Quick result:
  - improved metrics: `2 / 6`
  - severe regressions: none
  - preserved some current-branch NH partition gains:
    - `itczWidthDeg: 25.91 -> 25.837`
    - `subtropicalDryNorthRatio: 1.534 -> 1.512`
  - but the direct rollback splice still could not recover the circulation half of the contract:

- Contract:
  - start from archive donor branch `codex/world-class-weather-loop-archive-20260407-0745`
  - keep rollback donor scaffold files:
    - `src/weather/v2/core5.js`
    - `src/weather/v2/vertical5.js`
  - forward-port current preserve layer:
    - `src/weather/v2/microphysics5.js`
  - forward-port current adapter stack:
    - `src/weather/v2/state5.js`
    - `src/weather/validation/diagnostics.js`

## Architecture C2 decision

- Verdict: `integration_blocked_missing_dependency`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c2-donor-base-hybrid-benchmark.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c2-donor-base-hybrid-benchmark.md)

  - `src/weather/v2/cloudBirthTracing5.js`
  - `src/weather/v2/sourceTracing5.js`
  - `src/weather/v2/instrumentationBands5.js`
  - `src/weather/validation/diagnostics.js`
  - `scripts/agent/planetary-realism-audit.mjs`
- Benchmark outcome:
  - hybrid quick run did not start because donor `core5.js` still uses extensionless ESM imports under the current Node runtime
  - first live blocker: missing module resolution for `./grid`
  - donor-core compatibility gaps also remain:
    - `getCloudTransitionLedgerRaw`
    - `resetCloudTransitionLedger`
    - `getModuleTimingSummary`
    - `getConservationSummary`
    - `loadStateSnapshot`
    - `setReplayDisabledModules`

    - `resetCloudTransitionLedger`
    - `getModuleTimingSummary`
    - `getConservationSummary`
    - `loadStateSnapshot`
    - `setReplayDisabledModules`

## Architecture C4 decision

- Verdict: `bridge_implemented_ready_for_rerun`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c4-donor-core-integration-bridge.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c4-donor-core-integration-bridge.md)
- Bridge implementation:
  - donor runtime rewritten to explicit `.js` relative imports where required
  - donor-core compatibility methods added for the current audit stack
  - donor-base-first splice contract preserved
- Bridge summary:
  - rewritten relative import count: `29`
  - missing donor-core compatibility methods after bridge: `none`
- Next active phase: `Architecture C5: bridged donor-base hybrid rerun benchmark`

## Architecture C5 decision

- Verdict: `hybrid_boot_failure`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c5-bridged-hybrid-rerun-benchmark.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c5-bridged-hybrid-rerun-benchmark.md)
- Benchmark outcome:
  - the bridged hybrid cleared the original donor-core ESM and missing-method bootstrap blockers
  - the bridged hybrid still did not produce the expected quick benchmark summary artifact
  - failure message:
    - `Audit completed without expected summary artifact ... Matching files: none`
- Interpretation:
  - Architecture C is no longer blocked by the original donor-core import/API seam
  - the next boundary is now why the bridged hybrid exits without yielding a benchmark artifact
- Next active phase: `Architecture C6: bridged hybrid attribution design`

## Architecture C6 decision

- Verdict: `silent_no_artifact_exit`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c6-bridged-hybrid-attribution-design.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c6-bridged-hybrid-attribution-design.md)
- Attribution result:
  - exit code: `0`
  - expected summary artifact: missing
  - fallback default report artifact: missing
  - cycle violation artifact: missing
  - stdout summary JSON: absent
  - new worktree artifacts: none
  - only emitted process output was a `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` warning
- Interpretation:
  - the bridged donor/current hybrid was no longer failing on the original ESM/core-API seam
  - the next question was artifact-contract execution, not climate behavior yet
- Next active phase: `Architecture C7: bridged hybrid artifact contract repair`

## Architecture C7 decision

- Verdict: `cycle_guard_contract_block`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c7-bridged-hybrid-artifact-contract-repair.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c7-bridged-hybrid-artifact-contract-repair.md)
- Repair result:
  - explicit `main()` invocation removed the earlier silent-exit ambiguity
  - the bridged donor worktree is now blocked by [plan-guard.mjs](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/scripts/agent/plan-guard.mjs)
  - failure message:
    - `[agent plan guard] agent:planetary-realism-audit requires an active cycle directory with plan.md before it can run.`
- Interpretation:
  - Architecture C is no longer blocked by donor-core import/API compatibility
  - the next blocker is the heavy-command cycle contract in donor worktrees
- Next active phase: `Architecture C8: donor-worktree cycle contract repair`

## Architecture C8 decision

- Verdict: `post_cycle_runtime_failure`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c8-donor-worktree-cycle-contract-repair.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c8-donor-worktree-cycle-contract-repair.md)
- Repair result:
  - the donor-worktree cycle contract was created successfully
  - the bridged audit moved past plan-guard and into runtime execution
  - the first post-cycle runtime blocker was:
    - `ENOENT` for `scripts/agent/fixtures/headless-terrain-180x90.json`
- Interpretation:
  - the cycle contract is no longer the active blocker
  - the next missing boundary is the donor-worktree terrain fixture bundle
- Next active phase: `Architecture C9: donor-worktree runtime fixture repair`

## Architecture C9 decision

- Verdict: `runtime_fixture_contract_restored`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c9-donor-worktree-runtime-fixture-repair.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c9-donor-worktree-runtime-fixture-repair.md)
- Repair result:
  - the terrain fixture bundle was restored into the donor worktree
  - the bridged quick audit exited `0`
  - the requested quick artifact was emitted:
    - [earth-weather-architecture-c9-bridged-hybrid-quick.json](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/output/earth-weather-architecture-c9-bridged-hybrid-quick.json)
- Interpretation:
  - donor hybrid runtime contracts are now restored far enough to resume actual benchmark work
  - the next bounded move is now climate benchmarking, not more integration surgery
- Next active phase: `Architecture C10: cycled hybrid benchmark rerun`

## Architecture C10 decision

- Verdict: `quick_reject`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c10-cycled-hybrid-benchmark-rerun.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c10-cycled-hybrid-benchmark-rerun.md)
- Quick result:
  - improved metrics: `4 / 6`
  - severe regressions:
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S`
  - strong improvements:
    - `itczWidthDeg: 25.91 -> 24.221`
    - `subtropicalDryNorthRatio: 1.534 -> 1.317`
    - `subtropicalDrySouthRatio: 1.199 -> 0.593`
    - `midlatitudeWesterliesNorthU10Ms: 0.531 -> 1.061`
  - blocking regression:
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -371.9765`
- Interpretation:
  - the repaired donor/current hybrid is now a real benchmarked climate candidate
  - the next blocker is not integration anymore; it is a single severe circulation transport failure
- Next active phase: `Architecture C11: cycled hybrid flux inversion attribution`

## Architecture C11 decision

- Verdict: `equatorial_overturning_polarity_inversion`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c11-cycled-hybrid-flux-inversion-attribution.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c11-cycled-hybrid-flux-inversion-attribution.md)
- Attribution result:
  - equatorial total-water flux north: `148.97786 -> -381.81173`
  - equatorial zonal-mean vapor flux north: `160.44983 -> -274.70821`
  - equatorial eddy vapor flux north: `-12.37515 -> -105.45284`
  - equatorial low-level velocity mean: `11.78514 -> -20.46744`
  - ITCZ latitude still moves north and NH westerlies still improve
- Interpretation:
  - the repaired hybrid’s remaining blocker is an equatorial overturning polarity flip, not generic climate weakness
  - the next bounded move should target equatorial overturning sign while preserving the dry-belt and NH-westerly gains
- Next active phase: `Architecture C12: equatorial overturning sign contract design`

## Architecture C12 decision

- Verdict: `current_low_level_momentum_preserve_layer_required`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c12-equatorial-overturning-sign-contract-design.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c12-equatorial-overturning-sign-contract-design.md)
- Contract result:
  - preserve layer:
    - [windNudge5.js](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/src/weather/v2/windNudge5.js)
    - [windEddyNudge5.js](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/src/weather/v2/windEddyNudge5.js)
    - [nudging5.js](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/src/weather/v2/nudging5.js)
  - donor-core param ports:
    - `windNudgeParams.tauSurfaceSeconds: 7 * 86400 -> 8 * 3600`
    - `nudgeParams.tauQvS: 30 * 86400 -> 45 * 86400`
    - `nudgeParams.tauQvColumn: 12 * 86400 -> 18 * 86400`
    - `nudgeParams organized/subsidence relief quartet from current core`
- Interpretation:
  - C11 narrowed the defect to a low-level sign-control mismatch rather than a broad scaffold failure
  - the next bounded move is the actual sign-contract experiment on the donor scaffold
- Next active phase: `Architecture C13: equatorial overturning sign contract experiment`

## Architecture C13 decision

- Verdict: `quick_reject`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c13-equatorial-overturning-sign-contract-experiment.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c13-equatorial-overturning-sign-contract-experiment.md)
- Quick result:
  - improved metrics: `4 / 6`
  - severe regressions:
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S`
  - retained hybrid wins:
    - `itczWidthDeg: 25.91 -> 23.884`
    - `subtropicalDryNorthRatio: 1.534 -> 1.152`
    - `subtropicalDrySouthRatio: 1.199 -> 0.585`
    - `midlatitudeWesterliesNorthU10Ms: 0.531 -> 1.232`
  - blocking regression:
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -330.9854`
- Interpretation:
  - the donor/current hybrid is still strong almost everywhere we care about
  - the remaining blocker is now specific to sign-contract implementation rather than generic hybrid viability
- Next active phase: `Architecture C14: sign-contract implementation attribution`

## Architecture C14 decision

- Verdict: `zonal_mean_equatorial_reversal_still_vertical_scaffold_controlled`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c14-sign-contract-implementation-attribution.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c14-sign-contract-implementation-attribution.md)
- Attribution result:
  - total cross-equatorial vapor flux north: `-371.9765 -> -330.9854`
  - equatorial low-level velocity mean: `-20.46744 -> -19.4512`
  - equatorial zonal-mean vapor flux north: `-274.70821 -> -301.63909`
  - equatorial eddy vapor flux north: `-105.45284 -> -34.29106`
- Interpretation:
  - C13 improved the eddy-side failure but not the zonal-mean overturning branch
  - the remaining blocker is now best explained by donor-controlled vertical-scaffold behavior, not the preserved low-level nudging layer
- Next active phase: `Architecture C15: equatorial vertical-state contract experiment`

## Architecture C15 decision

- Verdict: `quick_reject`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c15-equatorial-vertical-state-contract-experiment.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c15-equatorial-vertical-state-contract-experiment.md)
- Quick result:
  - improved metrics: `4 / 6`
  - severe regressions:
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S`
  - bounded outcome:
    - `itczWidthDeg: 25.91 -> 24.094`
    - `subtropicalDryNorthRatio: 1.534 -> 1.404`
    - `subtropicalDrySouthRatio: 1.199 -> 0.589`
    - `midlatitudeWesterliesNorthU10Ms: 0.531 -> 1.209`
    - `northDryBeltOceanLargeScaleCondensationMeanKgM2: 0.1413 -> 0.15331`
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -364.55266`
- Interpretation:
  - the current vertical-state overlay did not restore northward equatorial overturning
  - it also weakened some of the stronger C13 improvements, so the vertical lane now needs narrower implementation attribution rather than a broader overlay
- Next active phase: `Architecture C16: vertical-contract implementation attribution`

## Architecture C16 decision

- Verdict: `zonal_mean_relief_offset_by_upper_cloud_carryover_recirculation`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c16-vertical-contract-implementation-attribution.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c16-vertical-contract-implementation-attribution.md)
- Attribution result:
  - equator zonal-mean vapor flux north: `-301.63909 -> -274.13377`
  - equator eddy vapor flux north: `-34.29106 -> -96.97265`
  - equator mid/upper vapor flux north: `-203.65605 -> -239.13535`
  - 35° interface vapor flux north: `-467.08734 -> -360.61691`
  - NH dry-belt carried-over upper cloud: `0 -> 0.39867`
  - NH dry-belt imported anvil persistence: `0 -> 0.39786`
  - NH dry-belt weak-erosion survival: `0 -> 0.38477`
  - NH dry-belt cloud recirculation proxy: `0 -> 2.22467`
- Interpretation:
  - C15 helped the zonal-mean equatorial branch and relieved north dry-belt import burden
  - but it reintroduced a strong upper-cloud carryover / persistence pathway that worsened the eddy-side and mid-upper transport enough to make the total cross-equatorial flux more negative

    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -353.31687`
- Interpretation:
  - the carryover carveout is live and materially better than C15 on the surface quick metrics
  - but the transport-sign blocker still survives, so the carveout needs attribution rather than annual promotion

  - 35° interface vapor flux north: `-360.61691 -> -373.49016`
- Interpretation:
  - C17 really did relieve the upper-cloud carryover lane and preserve the zonal-mean relief
  - the remaining dominant blocker is now the equatorial eddy export / low-level velocity branch, not upper-cloud carryover

  - 35° interface vapor flux north: `-467.08734 -> -373.49016`
- Interpretation:
  - the preserve layer itself is not the main blocker
  - the remaining defect sits in the vertical-overlay / eddy-export coupling on top of that shared preserve layer

- Interpretation:
  - softening only the surface eddy-energy rescaling lane preserved the hybrid’s broad climate wins
  - but it did not solve the equatorial sign defect and slightly worsened the core equatorial transport branches

- Attribution result:
  - relative to C17, C20 worsens the core equatorial transport branches:
    - equator zonal-mean vapor flux north: `-249.95949 -> -254.59421`
    - equator eddy vapor flux north: `-109.90385 -> -114.18489`
    - equator low-level velocity mean: `-20.79729 -> -21.02244`
  - while the NH dry-belt return/carryover family rebounds:
    - carried-over upper cloud: `0.22666 -> 0.27973`

    - weak-erosion survival: `0.21732 -> 0.26804`

    - return-branch mass flux: `3368.15697 -> 3490.3125`
- Interpretation:
  - global eddy softening was not inert
  - it relieved the wrong side of the hybrid and reopened the dry-belt carryover family without fixing the equatorial export defect
- Next active phase: `Architecture C22: equatorial-band eddy softening carveout experiment`

    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -355.11907`
- Interpretation:
  - narrowing the softening to the equatorial band preserved the broad quick-shape wins and improved NH dry-belt ocean condensation
  - but it still failed the quick gate because the cross-equatorial transport sign stayed inverted

- What changed relative to C17:
  - dry-belt containment stayed relieved:
    - carried-over upper cloud: `0.22666 -> 0.22097`
    - imported anvil persistence: `0.22501 -> 0.21933`
    - weak-erosion survival: `0.21732 -> 0.21143`
    - cloud recirculation proxy: `0.39988 -> 0.39849`
    - return-branch mass flux: `3368.15697 -> 3348.50751`
  - upper transport relieved slightly:
    - equator upper total-water flux north: `-13.44686 -> -13.3117`
  - lower/mid zonal branches worsened:
    - equator lower zonal vapor flux north: `-13.99991 -> -14.07888`
    - equator mid zonal vapor flux north: `-12.93476 -> -13.11577`
- Interpretation:
  - the C22 carveout preserved the dry-belt relief we wanted
  - but the remaining export defect is now concentrated in the inner equatorial core, especially the lower/mid zonal branch
- Next active phase: `Architecture C24: inner-core equatorial eddy softening experiment`

## Architecture C24 decision

    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -358.07208`
- Interpretation:
  - the inner-core narrowing improved ITCZ width and both dry-belt ratios relative to C22 and eased parts of the lower/mid equatorial branch
  - but it gave back some upper-branch relief, reintroduced carryover/return-branch rebound, and the transport-sign defect remained severe

- What changed relative to C22:
  - broad quick-shape metrics improved:
    - `itczWidthDeg: 23.499 -> 23.275`
    - `subtropicalDryNorthRatio: 1.137 -> 1.091`
    - `subtropicalDrySouthRatio: 0.51 -> 0.506`
  - boundary/lower/mid equatorial burden eased:
    - equator boundary-layer total-water flux north: `-5.01709 -> -4.84216`
    - equator lower total-water flux north: `-17.83744 -> -17.49403`
    - equator mid total-water flux north: `-16.77592 -> -16.75772`
  - but upper-branch and carryover support rebounded:
    - equator upper total-water flux north: `-13.3117 -> -13.59209`
    - carried-over upper cloud: `0.22097 -> 0.23253`
    - cloud recirculation proxy: `0.39849 -> 0.49385`
    - return-branch mass flux: `3348.50751 -> 3447.36194`
- Interpretation:
  - the inner-core narrowing helped the lower-mid core
  - but it removed too much useful shoulder support from the upper branch and dry-belt containment side
- Next active phase: `Architecture C26: partial equatorial shoulder restore experiment`

## Architecture C26 decision

    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -353.85346`
- Interpretation:
  - restoring a modest shoulder improved NH dry-belt ocean condensation and slightly reduced the cross-equatorial defect relative to C24
  - but it still failed the quick gate because the transport-sign inversion remained severe and some C24 dry-belt/ITCZ gains were given back
- Next active phase: `Architecture C27: partial equatorial shoulder restore attribution`

    - NH dry-belt ocean condensation: `0.12705 -> 0.11952`
  - reloaded:
    - equator lower total-water flux north: `-17.49403 -> -18.00423`
    - 35° lower vapor import: `-22.69662 -> -22.99819`
    - 35° mid vapor import: `-17.16362 -> -17.27508`
    - cloud recirculation proxy: `0.49385 -> 0.60796`
- Interpretation:
  - C26 moved in the right direction on the upper/return-flow side
  - but it over-restored the shoulder and reloaded the lower/import side, so the next move should weaken that restore instead of discarding it

    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -323.23581`
- Interpretation:
  - weakening the shoulder restore materially improved the sign defect and relieved the equatorial eddy branch relative to C26
  - but it gave back the NH dry-belt ocean-condensation improvement and still failed the quick gate, so the remaining blocker is now a sharper transport-vs-condensation tradeoff

    - carryover upper cloud: `0.2348 -> 0.24485`
    - imported anvil persistence: `0.23307 -> 0.24284`
    - cloud recirculation proxy: `0.60796 -> 0.74157`
- Interpretation:
  - weakening the shoulder restore really did relieve the equatorial eddy/export side
  - but it paid for that by reopening dry-belt carryover and ocean condensation, so the next move had to target carry-input recapture rather than the shoulder geometry itself
- Next active phase: `Architecture C30: weak restore carry-input recapture experiment`

## Architecture C30 decision

- Verdict: `quick_reject`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c30-weak-restore-carry-input-recapture-experiment.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c30-weak-restore-carry-input-recapture-experiment.md)

    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -353.96486`
- Interpretation:
  - strengthening the carry-input recapture recovered the NH dry-belt receiver side relative to C28 while preserving most of the broad quick-shape wins
  - but it did not repair the transport-sign inversion and actually made the cross-equatorial defect slightly worse than C28, so the next step is attribution rather than more blind recapture tuning

    - cloud recirculation proxy: `0.74157 -> 1.18525`
    - return-branch mass flux: `3444.87796 -> 3500.90278`
- Interpretation:
  - the stronger recapture fixed the receiver side and improved the zonal-mean branch
  - but it overpaid through the equatorial eddy/export side, so the next move had to protect organized equatorial cells rather than undoing the whole recapture layer

    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -356.96839`
- Interpretation:
  - restoring stricter organized-support and potential caps preserved the broad quick-shape gains and improved NH dry-belt ocean condensation even further
  - but it still failed on the same cross-equatorial sign defect, and the defect was marginally worse than C30, so the next step is another attribution pass rather than more cap tuning

- Interpretation:
  - the organized-support carveout direction was genuinely useful for receiver containment and the upper branch
  - but it over-tightened the lower-mid core, so the next move should keep the strict organized-support cap and only partially relax the potential cap

- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c34-potential-half-relax-carry-input-experiment.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c34-potential-half-relax-carry-input-experiment.md)
- Quick result:
  - improved metrics: `4 / 6`
  - severe regressions:
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S`
  - bounded outcome:
    - `itczWidthDeg: 25.91 -> 23.374`
    - `subtropicalDryNorthRatio: 1.534 -> 1.122`
    - `subtropicalDrySouthRatio: 1.199 -> 0.493`
    - `midlatitudeWesterliesNorthU10Ms: 0.531 -> 1.219`
    - `northDryBeltOceanLargeScaleCondensationMeanKgM2: 0.1413 -> 0.10807`
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -356.96839`
- Interpretation:
  - the potential half-relax was effectively inert at the quick-score level relative to C32
  - that means the strict organized-support cap or some other upstream admission condition is likely still the active binder, so the next step is attribution rather than more potential-cap nudging
- Next active phase: `Architecture C35: potential-half-relax carry-input attribution`

## Architecture C35 decision

- Verdict: `potential_half_relax_inert_potential_cap_not_primary_binder`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c35-potential-half-relax-carry-input-attribution.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c35-potential-half-relax-carry-input-attribution.md)
- Attribution result:
  - C34 is unchanged from C32 to reporting precision across:
    - quick score
    - equatorial transport
    - dry-belt receiver containment
    - thermodynamic regime classification
  - the strict potential cap is therefore not the live binder in this family
- Interpretation:
  - the remaining lower-mid equatorial core defect is being set by the strict organized-support admission side, not the potential cap
- Next active phase: `Architecture C36: organized-support half-relax carry-input experiment`

## Architecture C36 decision

- Verdict: `quick_reject`
- Decision report: [earth-weather-architecture-c36-organized-support-half-relax-carry-input-experiment.md](/Users/agentt/.openclaw/workspace/Developer/satellite-wars-worldclass/weather-validation/reports/earth-weather-architecture-c36-organized-support-half-relax-carry-input-experiment.md)
- Quick result:
  - improved metrics: `4 / 6`
  - severe regressions:
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S`
  - bounded outcome:
    - `itczWidthDeg: 25.91 -> 23.315`
    - `subtropicalDryNorthRatio: 1.534 -> 1.093`
    - `subtropicalDrySouthRatio: 1.199 -> 0.502`
    - `midlatitudeWesterliesNorthU10Ms: 0.531 -> 1.232`
    - `northDryBeltOceanLargeScaleCondensationMeanKgM2: 0.1413 -> 0.12693`
    - `crossEquatorialVaporFluxNorthKgM_1S: 143.95306 -> -353.96486`
- Interpretation:
  - half-relaxing organized support is active, unlike C34
  - but it mostly collapses back toward the earlier C30 tradeoff:
    - some receiver-side relief is given back
    - the cross-equatorial sign defect remains severe
- Next active phase: `Architecture C37: organized-support half-relax carry-input attribution`
